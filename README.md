# Titanic_Competition

This repository is dedicated to the Titanic Competition on Kaggle
I plan to develop several (3+) ML models to predict which passengers on the Titanic survived its sinking based on the provided training data.
After developing several individual models, I will put forth an ensemble model in the hopes of improving on my prediction.

Notes:
  The models selected should be focused PRIMARILY on predictive capability, w/ little to no need for easy of interpretability
